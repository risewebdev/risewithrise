		<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;padding-left: 20%;padding-right: 20%;line-height: 150%">In a city troubled with socio-political conflicts round the year, the state of distress that young and old tend to face has paced up to make every process of learning and understanding difficult. Being born and brought up in a cocoon of protection, it is a very common estimation that at an age where a child has to decide about his/her career, a Kashmiri kid fails to make a decision. He/She fails to balance a degree demanding to professionalism. And this is the reason that many of brilliant minds fail to perform. Over the course of years, it has been estimated that the representation of students from Kashmir in premier institutions is the lowest in country. According to the census reports of 2011, it is estimated that Kashmir constitutes 1% of the total population of the country where as the percentage of students studying in premier institutes is less than 0.05 % in any top Indian institutions like IIT, IIM etc. 
These problems exist throughout the financial spectrum and of course more at the bottom of pyramid. A need for a path to pathless, hope to the hopeless was of an utmost importance.

	<div style="text-align: center;background-color: #BABABA;padding-top: 1%">
	<h1 style="color: #FF0004">HOW AT RiSE WE STARTED SOLVING THE PROBLEM</h1><br>
		<p style="color: #222;font-size: 20px;padding-left: 20%;padding-right: 20%;padding-bottom: 2%">An idea calibrated by young blazing minds from the IIT Bombay & IIT Kharagpur, settled together to create an opportunity in a conflict hit society where the working availability is exponentially less. RiSE being one of the  most successful educational institute in Kashmir has always crossed all hurdles in a war-torn conflict zone with its journey filled with socio-economic challenges, innovations and passion to remove inequality in the society. <br><br>
When we at RiSE started working in Kashmir, people viewed us with scepticism as it was a first of its kind initiative but, we never gave up. We learned to create community support and work according to mindset and requirements of people as it was something that was needed to be done despite the insularity of the conflict zone we were working in. The hardest of challenges was during the conflict-hit months of 2016.. Educational institutes, public transport and internet was shut.  Despite this calamity, ours was the only functional institute in Kashmir. 
An idea to create one such programme felt like the need of an hour. It was a very humble thought that made us to say that  if we don’t do what we are doing no one else will. If we discontinue, the students’ education suffers and the society suffers. Our work and our vale is an island of hope in the ocean of hopelessness. An opportunity where the young could find out a way to get to know their interests better and find a path to begin with something in life. We empower them through all the resources and connections we have in different sectors of India and abroad. And as our students speak of their journey at RiSE,<span style="color: #e28d55;font-weight: 600">“Not leading others but leading others to their goals is the most amazing thing you are doing.”</span> <br><br>
<span style="color: black;font-size: 25px">At RISE, we plan to create future leaders and change makers. </span>

	<h1 style="color: #FF0004">THE FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM</h1>
		<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;padding-left: 20%;padding-right: 20%;line-height: 150%">To handle the multi-folds problem and create a long lasting impact by touching more souls especially of the underprivileged section of the society - we introduce to you the RiSE fellowship.<br>
The RiSE Fellowship Program is an opportunity for every blazing mind to Collaborate, Empower and Educate. For the most optimistic youth, from the best universities and workplaces, to serve as full-time teachers & problem solvers to children from low-income communities in the beautiful vale of Kashmir, RiSE fellowship is a workplace for enhancing life skills, experiential learning, creating enough confidence in students' minds such that they know they can lead their life. In the process of learning, this programme will be a road to realize the essence of leadership, problem solving techniques and a greed and need for driving a change for a better tomorrow. With our model to collaborate, every fellow will be provided with a space to create a bond with students and assess their challenges and find better collaborations. With your excellence, you will be an inspiration to the growing buds and a motivation for them to chase the best and never settle for mediocrity. Through this entire experience of teaching in classrooms and working with key education stakeholders like students, principals, and parents, we believe that our Fellows get exposed to the grass-root realities of the state’s education system. It is an added opportunity to begin to cultivate knowledge, skills, and mentality which poses to be very necessary to attain positions of leadership in education and identify their role in building a wider movement for education quality in Kashmir.<br>
The fellowship offers a very feasible duration of work starting from 6 months to 1 year and it is an opportunity to allow you break the shackles of old methodology of teaching and teacher-student gap. A challenge to challenge the old system and get a broader, friendly and an easier mode of learning and interacting.

	<h1 style="color: #FF0004">RECRUITMENT AND TRAINING</h1><br>
		<p style="color: #222;font-size: 20px;padding-left: 20%;padding-right: 20%;padding-bottom: 2%">In the middle of every difficulty, lies an opportunity. At RiSE fellowship program, we believe to create future leaders from the conflict. We aim to recruit most promising college graduates from a diverse array of backgrounds including the nation’s best colleges<span style="color:#e28d55;font-weight: 600"> (IIT, IIM, BITS, DTU, NIT, St. Stephen’s College, etc)</span>. 
<br>
Fellows applying need to complete and follow up with a multiple round of interviews. In the interviews, the primary thing to be tested will be to check the level of commitment and perseverance in the fellow. Also, it will be greatly considered if the fellow proceeds to bring about the best changes in the near future. <br>

Following recruitment, the selected fellows will undergo through a thorough training period which will be offered by experts from various fields. It will help them in general awareness and understanding the basic methodology for teaching students to help crack various competitive exams.

	<h1 style="color: #FF0004">IMPACT OF A RiSE FELLOW</h1>
		<p style="color: white;font-size: 20px;padding-left: 20%;padding-right: 20%;line-height: 150%">The RiSE fellowship has an entirely different way of pursuing experience and getting an opportunity to teach and mentor the conflict-hit Kashmiris. Despite the steeper challenges and irregularity in the academic session, very bright kids from different areas, rural or urban, never fail to amaze us with their creativity and intellect. To deal and work with such a community is a new thing in itself and crossing all these hurdles over the entire course of fellowship is what makes this fellowship different from the other prestigious ones present. 
<br>
At RiSE fellowship, the fellows become the faces of the organisation. They not only get to conduct classes but they are provided with an opportunity to run the classes in the particular area, supervise the working and analyze the talent among students. In the fellowship, every fellow doesn’t just work as one but he is the representative of that sector, which pertinently can’t be offered in any of the fellowships. Also, since it’s first of its kind, every fellow will get to know about each and everything from the scratch. Entrepreneur skill enhancement, teaching experience, bearing social and political pressure, are some of the main and highlighting features of the fellowship.

Kashmir, despite being the heaven on Earth is very famous for its kind hearted people who are always there to welcome you with their hearts. A city of Saints, of faith and belief, Kashmir holds a rich cultural ethnicity where everything is safe and sound. If you even plan to think of conflict and trouble when Kashmir comes to your plan, swap it by hospitable and culturally rich aura.</p>
